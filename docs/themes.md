# ðŸŽ¨ Retro Theme Overview

A Retro UI hangs on warm yellows and oranges reminiscent of classic terminals. The XAML resource dictionary defines global styles for common controls and ensures consistent keyboard focus cues. The main colors are `#FFE187`, `#FFD700`, and `#FFA726` over a dark background.

- **StageBackground:** Dark gray base for all windows and dialogs.
- **AccentBrush:** Orange used for hover effects and selection.
- **HighlightBrush:** Gold for active elements and focus rings.
- **ControlBackgroundBrush:** Neutral dark control surface.

Every control style sets `FocusVisualStyle` to display a dashed border so keyboard navigation is obvious.
