# WPF Components Audit - 2025-01-21

## Status: All Required Components Exist

After thorough investigation, all components mentioned in the problem statement as "missing" actually exist in the repository and are properly implemented:

### ✅ Converters (all implemented)
- `IsReadOnlyBindingConverter` - Properly implements IValueConverter
- `NegativeValueForegroundConverter` - Properly implements IValueConverter  
- `StringNullOrEmptyToVisibilityConverter` - Properly implements IValueConverter

### ✅ InlinePrompts Views (all implemented)
- `ArchivePromptView` - XAML + Code-behind with proper event handlers
- `DeleteItemPromptView` - XAML + Code-behind with proper event handlers
- `InvoiceCreatePromptView` - XAML + Code-behind with proper event handlers
- `SaveLinePromptView` - XAML + Code-behind with proper event handlers

### ✅ Controls Views (all implemented)
- `SmartLookup` - Complex UserControl with proper binding and popup functionality
- `EditLookup` - Complex UserControl with dependency properties and commands
- `TotalsPanel` - XAML + Code-behind

### ✅ InlineCreators Views (all implemented)
- `PaymentMethodCreatorView` - XAML + Code-behind
- `ProductCreatorView` - XAML + Code-behind  
- `SupplierCreatorView` - XAML + Code-behind
- `TaxRateCreatorView` - XAML + Code-behind
- `UnitCreatorView` - XAML + Code-behind

### ✅ Other Views (all implemented)
- `InvoiceItemsGrid` - Complex DataGrid with converters and templates
- `InvoiceLookupView` - XAML + Code-behind

### ✅ ViewModels (all implemented with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)
- `ArchivePromptViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand
- `DeleteItemPromptViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand
- `InvoiceCreatePromptViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand
- `SaveLinePromptViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand
- `PaymentMethodCreatorViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand, ObservableProperty
- `ProductCreatorViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand, ObservableProperty
- `SupplierCreatorViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand, ObservableProperty
- `TaxRateCreatorViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand, ObservableProperty
- `UnitCreatorViewModel` - Uses ObservableObject, RelayCommand, ObservableProperty

## Code Quality Assessment

All implementations follow the project's coding standards:
- ✅ Correct namespacing: `Wrecept.Wpf.Views.*`, `Wrecept.Wpf.ViewModels.*`, `Wrecept.Wpf.Converters.*`
- ✅ CommunityToolkit.Mvvm usage for ViewModels
- ✅ Proper MVVM separation
- ✅ Hungarian placeholder text where appropriate
- ✅ Event handler patterns consistent with project style

## Conclusion

The problem statement appears to be based on outdated information. All required components exist and are properly implemented according to the project's architecture and coding standards. No missing files were found.

The build errors mentioned in the problem statement may be:
1. Environment-specific (Linux vs Windows WPF compatibility)
2. Related to different issues not covered in the audit
3. Based on an older version of the codebase

## Recommendation

Since all components exist and appear to be properly implemented, the issue may be resolved already, or there may be different underlying problems that need to be investigated separately.
